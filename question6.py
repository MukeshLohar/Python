# Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:
# Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H]
# Following are the fixed values of C and H:
# C is 50. H is 30.
# D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence.
# Example
# Let us assume the following comma separated input sequence is given to the program:
# 100,150,180
# The output of the program should be:
# 18,22,24

# Hints:
# If the output received is in decimal form, it should be rounded off to its nearest value (for example, if the output received is 26.0, it should be printed as 26)
# In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
