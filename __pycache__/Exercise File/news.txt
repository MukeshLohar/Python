Hiding ideas
------------
Some people hesitate to share an idea because they’re worried it will be stolen.
In general, these people are afraid of success, not failure. An idea unspoken is a safe one, which not only can’t be stolen, but it can’t be tested, criticized, improved or used in the real world.
That is all for today!

Beyond a shadow
---------------
How certain do you need to be?
When presented with a new opportunity, or a risk to be avoided, do you have any doubts?
Because there are always doubts. And then we multiply it, waiting for the doubt to go away, for it to not only be a shadow of what it was, but beyond that…
The desire to avoid change is rarely held to the same standards as progress. By the time the shadow is gone, it might be too late.

“The way we’ve always done it”
------------------------------
But, if we were on the spot to analyze our day, our processes and our assumptions, how many things do we do simply because we are in the habit?
It’s impossible to try every option, to explore every alternative and examine how every culture or competitor does things, but…
If we don’t even know we’re doing things by rote, when will we be restless enough to try to make them better?
That is all for today!

Blunders and mistakes
---------------------
In our vigilance to avoid blunders, sometimes we try to eliminate mistakes as well.
For understandable reasons, we spend a lot of time trying to avoid blunders and minimizing mistakes. But if that’s all we do, we’ve given up the chance to do something magical.
If you’re working on the frontier, if you’re leading, creating or inventing, you’ve signed up for mistakes. That’s the price of innovation.
After the fact, it’s easy for an attempt at great work to look like nothing but a blunder. But it might simply be a mistake that we can learn from.

What’s your game?
-----------------
That’s way too literal.
Someone who trades pork bellies on the floor of the commodities exchange might believe that she has a particular affinity to pork bellies, and that the specific is the game.
Still too literal.
In the first case, the ‘game’ isn’t the silver hat, the properties or even the Monopoly set. The game is the way it feels to engage with the regular group and the thrill of trading and perhaps winning. It would be possible to replicate or even surpass this game by playing Othello instead, or scouring garage sales to sell hidden treasures on eBay…
In the second case, the ‘game’ might actually be the thrill of the trade. Or it might be the satisfaction the trader gets from having an easily measured indicator (wealth) go up. Or it might be the status that comes from being richer than the folks you went to high school with…
We invent all sorts of trappings and decide that the trappings are our work. They’re not. There are only a handful of games that most people decide to play… games that have boundaries, other players, connections and outcomes. You can switch from one set of trappings to another much more easily than you imagine, particularly if you focus on the basic building blocks of your game instead of the outward appearance.
If someone takes away your playing piece, don’t fall into the trap of deciding you can’t play a game any longer.
If someone tries to persuade you that the game is to make as much money as possible, realize that they need more insight and imagination.
Whenever you can, it might pay to seek to create a game that works for you and for those you seek to serve. Because those games are the sustainable ones and the ones that you can play for a long time to come.

New decisions
-------------
“I was wrong,” isn’t something you hear very often. Particularly from people in power, or folks who have gone out on a limb espousing a belief.
It’s far easier to persuade someone to make a new decision based on new information.
That way, they can be right now, and they can also believe that they were right before.

The problem with a mic drop
---------------------------
The problem is that then you have to bend over and pick up the microphone.
Conversations take more effort but tend to be worth it.

A place to write
----------------
And a huge advantage of having a daily blog is that the software is always open, waiting for you to write something.
Your story doesn’t have to be a book, it is simply your chance to make a difference. “Here’s what I see, here’s how you can be part of it.”
When we remove the pre (finding the pen, the paper, the notebook, the software) and the post (finding a way to publish it), it turns out that we write more often, and writing more often leads to writing better.
It doesn’t have to be perfect, it can simply be the next thing you do.
The patterns matter. Streaks work.
All part of your practice.
That is all for today!

Seeing differently
------------------
Here are some books for the end of the year… fifty years of ideas that have helped me understand the world differently:
Gödel, Escher, Bach — Before meta was cool, Douglas Hofstadter won a Pulitzer Prize for this intricately created examination of math, art and music.
Caste — My book of the year. Wilkerson helps us see how persistent and hidden the indoctrination of race and status lie in our culture.
Understanding Comics — Another meta book, and a masterpiece of explanation and insight.
The Red Queen — There are a ton of very cool books on evolutionary theory and this one is particularly good.
Knocking on Heaven’s Door — Lisa Randall’s explanation of physics will change the way you look at the world.
Guns, Germs and Steel — Another classic, it has earned its spot in the canon. An explanation (not without controversy) of how the world ended up as it did. This is what the study of geography is actually about.
The Beginning of Infinity — After you read Randall, this book will take those ideas and expand them. A lot.
Impro — This book transformed the way I saw human interaction, and had a significant impact in the creation of This is Marketing.
What Technology Wants — Kevin Kelly has changed my mind over and over again, and this one is the one I think about the most often.
The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas — A short story from Ursula LeGuin that you will never forget.
Debt — An astonishing look at 5,000 years of human history by the late David Graeber.
The Jazz of Physics — A great book, even (especially) for people who think they don’t like either.
When Things Fall Apart — Each of Pema’s books is special, and the audio books in particular. This is a fine place to start.
Books are an extraordinary device, transitioning through time and space, moving from person to person and leaving behind insight and connection. I’m grateful every single day for the privilege of being able to read (and to write).
And writing doesn’t always have to take the form of books. Check out this prize-winning video:

The paradox of discernment
--------------------------
A harried traveler simply wolfs down a hamburger, not really worried or aware of its provenance or flavor.
And a bureaucrat buys whatever is cheapest and meets spec, without regard for how well it is designed or the supply chain that created it.
Enthusiasts will work their whole lives to be able to tell the difference in how an orchestra sounds, or how the chocolate is tempered or the simple elegance of thoughtful engineering.
And then, once we do, the incompetent or mediocre stuff isn’t worth much.
In order to appreciate the truly great work, we often end up becoming disappointed with the rest.
